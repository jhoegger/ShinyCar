# ShinyCar
This is a shiny app for analysis of the Motor Trends Car dataset

You can use the sliders to change the number of cylinders and gears used for the analysis

Change the sliders and see the impact that the number of cylinders and gears have on MPG and other variables

Have fun playing with the app!
